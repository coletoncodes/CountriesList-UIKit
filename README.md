# CountriesList-UIKit
A simple UIKit application that fetches a list of Countries via URLSession and displays them in a list.

## Features:
- Fetches a list of all available countries
- Search functionality

## Technical Skills:
- Dependency Injection with [Factory](https://github.com/hmlongco/Factory)
- Model-View-View-Model Architecture
- Async/Await 
- @MainActor
- Reactive via ObservableObject, @Published, and Combine sink
- Caching on initial fetch, locally persisted via UserDefaults
- Protocol Oriented Programming

### Future Improvements:
- More in depth unit-testing
- Advanced filtering
- Detail view of a selected country in the list

#### Further Discussion:
I created this project to freshen up on UIKit, and programmatic UI.
